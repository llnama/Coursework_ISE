# Bug Type Classification Tool

This project trains various models to classify user-reported issues into specific bug types. It provides a script to compare their results visually. This tool aims to help developers prioritise and manage issue reports more efficiently.

### `improvedv3.py` is the python script containing the model with the best performance

To run each script, run the following command: `python {script_name}.py`

To compare two csv results, change the filenames in the `plot.py` file and run `python plot.py`
